A very detail oriented, comprehensive document.

#### Format
1. Executive Summary: Briefly tell your reader what your company is and why it will be successful. Include your mission statement, your product or service, and basic information about your companyâ€™s leadership team, employees, and location. You should also include financial information and high-level growth plans if you plan to ask for financing.
2. Company Description: Use your company description to provide detailed information about your company. Go into detail about the problems your business solves. Be specific, and list out the consumers, organization, or businesses your company plans to serve. Explain the competitive advantages that will make your business a success. Are there experts on your team? Have you found the perfect location for your store? Your company description is the place to boast about your strengths.
3. Market Analysis: You'll need a good understanding of your industry outlook and target market. Competitive research will show you what other businesses are doing and what their strengths are. In your market research, look for trends and themes. What do successful competitors do? Why does it work? Can you do it better? Now's the time to answer these questions.
4. Organization and management: Use an organizational chart to lay out who's in charge of what in your company. Show how each person's unique experience will contribute to the success of your venture. Consider including resumes and CVs of key members of your team. Also describe the legal structure of your company.
5. Service or Product line: Describe what you sell or what service you offer. Explain how it benefits your customers and what the product lifecycle looks like.
6. Marketing and Sales: Your goal in this section is to describe how you'll attract and retain customers. You'll also describe how a sale will actually happen. You'll refer to this section later when you make financial projections, so make sure to thoroughly describe your complete marketing and sales strategies.
